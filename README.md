## Usage

### Configuration

Before running the app, you can configure various settings in the `config.dart` file. Adjust ad frequency, API endpoints, and other relevant options to suit your needs.

### Loading Advertisements

To load advertisements from a remote source, implement the necessary API calls in the `AdService` class. You can customize the logic for fetching and displaying ads based on your preferred ad network.

The app's look and feel can be tailored to your brand by modifying the themes in the `themes.dart` file. Adjust colors, fonts, and UI elements to create a unique visual identity.

### Ad Integration
